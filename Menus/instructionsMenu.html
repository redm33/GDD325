	Move around the room and interact with objects using your mouse. If you need to seperate objects, hold R and click the object.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>User Interface:</b><br/>
    Use items in your inventory by clicking on them and then clicking on the<br/> 
    object you wish to use it on. Open your journal by clicking on the small<br/> 
    journal image; close it by clicking on the same icon.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Guidance:</b><br/>
    If you are ever stuck you can nicely ask the alchemist if he would be willing<br/>
    to give you some hints. You may want to check your journal as well!</p>
